# What is That? What is This?

Sometimes, I read articles, or watch video to learn Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning. I always see new word or terms that I have never heard of. That's why I decided to put those in here. 

1. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) [[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805), [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BERT_(language_model))]
